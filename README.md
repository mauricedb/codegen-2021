# Build reliable web applications using Cypress

Tired of having users email you that your web application is broken? Turns out that building reliable web applications is hard and requires a lot of testing. You can write unit tests but quite often these all pass and the application is still broken. Why? Because they test parts of the application in isolation. But for a reliable application we need more. We need to make sure that all parts work together as intended.

Cypress is a great tool to achieve this. It will test you complete web application in the browser and use it like a real user would. In this session Maurice will show you how to use Cypress during development and on the CI server. He will share tips and tricks to make your tests more resilient and more like how an actual end user would behave.
